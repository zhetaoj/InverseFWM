# InverseFWM
Inverse-design for spontaneous four-wave mixing based on EMopt
We propose an inverse design approach to amplify the efficiency of on-chip photon pair generation. We implement this strategy using the open-source package EmOpt. Our method employs a multi-frequency co-optimization strategy and calculates gradients with respect to the design parameters via the
adjoint method. The resulting efficiency enhancement stems not only from the increased field intensity due to the confinement of light in high quality factor cavity resonances but also from the improvement of phase-matching conditions, along with coupling between the cavity and
waveguide mode considered in the design.
